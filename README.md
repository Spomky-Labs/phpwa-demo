# Symfony + PWA = ðŸ’•

## Introduction

This application is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) built with Symfony and [PHPWA](https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/phpwa-bundle).

A live demo is available here: https://pwa.spomky-labs.net/

## Getting Started

This project uses [Castor](https://github.com/jolicode/castor) to simplify development tasks. All commands below assume you have `castor` installed globally (via Composer or PHAR).

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose v2.10+
- [Castor](https://github.com/jolicode/castor#installation)

### Launch the Project

```bash
castor build     # Build the Docker images
castor start     # Start the application and its services
```

Then open [https://localhost](https://localhost) in your browser and accept the self-signed TLS certificate if prompted.

To stop the project:

```bash
castor stop
```

To rebuild everything from scratch:

```bash
castor destroy --force
castor build
castor start
```
